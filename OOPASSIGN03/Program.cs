            //b) To define a blueprint for a class
            //c) To declare abstract methods and properties
            //d) To create instances of objects

            //In C#, can an interface inherit from another interface?
            //a) No, interfaces cannot inherit from each other
            //b) Yes, interfaces can inherit from multiple interfaces
            //c) Yes, but only if they have the same methods

            // What is the purpose of an explicit interface implementation in C#?
            //a) To hide the interface members from outside access
            //b) To provide a clear separation between interface and class members
            //c) To allow multiple classes to implement the same interface
